## Example of using random python code I found on google (as I don't yet know how to code) in a Github index.md file 
import math

def calculate_area(radius):
    return math.pi * radius ** 2

# Example usage
radius = 5
area = calculate_area(radius)
print(f"The area of the circle with radius {radius} is {area:.2f}")
